RIGHT NOW, IT IS ONLY SENDING MESSAGES FROM CLIENT TO SERVER TO BE PRINTED.

To run, navigate to the project directory.

In a terminal, launch the data server with `python3 data_server.py`.

Without closing that terminal, bind the app server with `python3 app_server.py` in a second terminal.

In a third terminal, connect to the app server with the client with `python3 client.py`.

In the same terminal that ran the client.py command, you can input commands which should connect to the `app_server` which would connect to the `data_server`.
